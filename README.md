# project1-fight-club

deployed: https://naughty-lamarr-dc1b58.netlify.app/

Simple 2 player fighting game using gifs for attacks. Used HTML CSS and JavaScript for the project. Once i learn more languages and different methods I'd like to come back and add on to the game.

=====TECHNOLOGIES=====
- Html
- Css
- JavaScript

=====FUTURE ADD-ONS=====
- Would like to add more characters to the roster.
- Want to make the attacks only run once before resetting to an idle position, reguardless of the time span of the attack. As of right now the attacks are on a loop until the set time out takes effect.

=====PROBLEMS=====
- Could not change the size of the characters. Changing the size includes the entire attack animation so it would vary between each attack and each character.
- Each attack for every character takes a different amount of time. As of now I used a set time out of abt three secounds before returning the characters to an idle position. During which time the attacks are on a continuous loop.
